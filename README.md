## Overview

The aim of this application is to connect users with tour guides and facilitate memorable experiences. Our tour postings can be freely browsed or filtered through via our search function. After creating a profile, users can access user-specific features. Once they've found a tour they like, our user can sign up for it and eagerly await their next adventure.
